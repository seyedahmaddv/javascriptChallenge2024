Repository for the Challenges ðŸ“‚
To make it easier for developers to explore similar challenges, Iâ€™ve created a GitHub repository:

This repository includes:

A folder for this specific challenge: christmas-list-duplicates
Starter code, solutions, and clear README instructions.
Why a GitHub Repo?

Users can star or fork the repo to support you.
They can follow along with similar challenges you upload in the future.
Itâ€™s a great way to showcase your coding skills!

# Instructions for Running the Project  

Thank you for downloading this folder! Follow the steps below to set it up correctly and view the project in your browser:

---

## Step-by-Step Guide  
1. **Open the Folder in Visual Studio Code**  
   - Extract the downloaded folder if it's in a `.zip` file.  
   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.  
   - Go to **File > Open Folder** and select this project folder.  

2. **Install the Live Server Extension**  
   - In Visual Studio Code, go to the **Extensions** tab (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).  
   - Search for **"Live Server"** by *Ritwick Dey* and install it.  

3. **Run the HTML File Using Live Server**  
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in your project folder.  
   - Select **"Open with Live Server"**.  
   - The project will open in your default browser, and you'll see it running properly.

## Why Live Server is Necessary?  
Due to JavaScript security restrictions, this project may **not work correctly** if you open the HTML file directly in the browser using double-click. **Live Server** creates a local server, which helps JavaScript files execute properly without these limitations.
