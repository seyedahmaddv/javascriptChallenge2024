Repository for the Challenges ðŸ“‚
To make it easier for developers to explore similar challenges, Iâ€™ve created a GitHub repository:

This repository includes:

A folder for this specific challenge: christmas-list-duplicates
Starter code, solutions, and clear README instructions.
Why a GitHub Repo?

Users can star or fork the repo to support you.
They can follow along with similar challenges you upload in the future.
Itâ€™s a great way to showcase your coding skills!
